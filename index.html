      <h3>Hello, I'm Natalie</h3>
      <p>My professional experience includes event management, nonprofit fundraising, and strategic marketing.</p>
      <aside>
        <h4>In my free time...</h4>
        <p>I enjoy exploring the great Pacific Northwest with my husband and two beautiful dogs. My hobbies keep me outdoors year-round, whether it is hiking, quading, camping, kayaking, biking, or skiing.</p>

      <h3>Why am I taking this course?</h3>
      <p>I've managed websites before, but I am only self-taught in HTML 5 and CSS, and have barely skimmed the surface of Javascript. I'm really hoping his class will help to polish up my skills, and fill in some gaps in my knowledge about coding.</p>
